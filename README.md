# Mapping Open Data and Engineering Fictions Workshop for Love Data Week 2019

This repository contains the presentation, teaching materials and data for the practical workshop 'Mapping Open Data and Engineering Fictions’ by Oliver Dawkins & Dr Jessica Foley from the Building City Dashboards project at Maynooth University, Ireland.

In this session participants are introduced to the [Building City Dashboards](http://dashboards.maynoothuniversity.ie/) project and Dr Foley's [Engineering Fictions](https://engineeringfictions.wordpress.com/) methodology. The practical workkshop then shows participants how to find open data in Ireland and create meaningful maps using free and open source software QGIS. The session ends with a creative writing activity which uses Engineering Fictions to prompt creative and critical reflections on the nature of data and the process of mapping.
